# Welcome to Theary Background Check API Documentation

The Theary Background Check API provides comprehensive criminal record evaluation through multiple AI-powered decision engines. The API orchestrates processing through XML transformation, compliance rule evaluation, and machine learning models to deliver detailed criminal record assessments for background screening.

## About Public Records

The API processes public records data from various sources including:

- **Court Records** - Federal, state, and county court records
- **State Repositories** - State-level criminal history databases
- **Federal Databases** - Federal criminal records and watchlists
- **Registry Data** - Sex offender registries and other specialized registries

All public records are processed through our multi-engine evaluation system to provide accurate, compliant background check results.

## API Organization

This documentation is organized into the following sections to help you integrate with the Background Check API:

## How to Access the API

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

Contact your account manager or support team to obtain your API key. Your API key will be in the format:

```
eval-api-key-<your-unique-key>
```

### Step 2: Exchange API Key for JWT Token

Use your API key to obtain a JWT token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://awp-ai-eval-framework-cr-dev-859798439223.us-south1.run.app/auth/token \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Step 3: Start Evaluating Records

Once you have your JWT token, you can start evaluating criminal records:

```bash
curl -X POST https://awp-ai-eval-framework-cr-dev-859798439223.us-south1.run.app/evaluate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "engines": ["SLM", "CE", "T5"],
    "record": {
      "xml": "<ScreeningResults>...</ScreeningResults>",
      "search_id": "76190bc0-e58c-494f-92c5-0c9a47389528",
      "search_date": "2024-01-15"
    }
  }'
```

For detailed instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](/quickstart) or [Authentication Guide](/authentication).

## Architecture

The Background Check API orchestrates a multi-step workflow:

1. **XML-Transformer** - Transforms raw XML criminal records into structured JSON (sequential)
2. **Compliance-Engine** - Evaluates records against compliance rules (parallel)
3. **SLM Engine** - Evaluates records through Structured Language Model evaluation (parallel)
4. **T5 Model API** - Provides additional ML-based evaluation capabilities (parallel)
