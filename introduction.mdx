title: Theary Background Check API Documentation
---

The Theary Background Check API provides comprehensive criminal record evaluation for background screening. The API processes public records through identity matching, compliance evaluation, and regulatory analysis to deliver accurate, compliant background check results.

## About Public Records

The API processes public records data from various sources including:

- **Court Records** - Federal, state, and county court records
- **State Repositories** - State-level criminal history databases
- **Federal Databases** - Federal criminal records and watchlists
- **Registry Data** - Sex offender registries and other specialized registries

All public records are processed through our comprehensive evaluation system to provide accurate, compliant background check results.

## API Organization

This documentation is organized into the following sections to help you integrate with the Background Check API:

## How to Access the API

### Step 1: Get Your API Key

Contact your account manager or support team to obtain your API key. Your API key will be in the format:

```
eval-api-key-<your-unique-key>
```

### Step 2: Exchange API Key for JWT Token

Use your API key to obtain a JWT token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://awp-ai-eval-framework-cr-dev-859798439223.us-south1.run.app/auth/token \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Step 3: Start Evaluating Records

Once you have your JWT token, you can start evaluating criminal records:

```bash
curl -X POST https://awp-ai-eval-framework-cr-dev-859798439223.us-south1.run.app/evaluate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "record": {
      "xml": "<ScreeningResults>...</ScreeningResults>",
      "search_id": "76190bc0-e58c-494f-92c5-0c9a47389528",
      "search_date": "2024-01-15"
    }
  }'
```

For detailed instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](/quickstart) or [Authentication Guide](/authentication).

## How It Works

The Public Records API processes background check requests through a comprehensive evaluation pipeline:

1. **Identity Matching** - Advanced fuzzy matching to verify candidate identity against criminal records using probabilistic algorithms
2. **Compliance Evaluation** - Rule-based evaluation against federal (FCRA) and state-specific regulations
3. **AI-Powered Analysis** - Machine learning models provide additional insights and risk assessment
4. **Reportability Determination** - Final decision on whether records can be reported based on regulatory requirements
